### **# ESP-NOW Motion Tracker Project**



This project demonstrates a motion tracking setup using the \*\*ESP-NOW protocol\*\*.



\## Project Overview

\- The system consists of \*\*three senders (nodes)\*\* and \*\*one receiver (gateway)\*\*.

\- The senders broadcast data to the receiver over ESP-NOW, enabling low-latency, peer-to-peer communication.



\## Initial Testing

\- In the initial tests, each sender counted numbers from 1 to 1000 at \*\*50 ms intervals\*\*.

\- The results of these tests were collected and will later be published as a detailed \*\*documentation\*\*.



\## Notes

\- The receiver acts as a gateway to gather data from all nodes.

\- This setup serves as a foundation for more complex motion tracking and sensor data aggregation projects.
